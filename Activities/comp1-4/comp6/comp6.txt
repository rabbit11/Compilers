    We added to the grammar more operators and a declaration of variables so that 
    the grammar now accepts a program like 
          a = 1  b = 3  : (- (+ a 2) 3)
    The result of the evaluation would be 0. Another program would be
          g = 3  t = 9  : (* (- t 7) g)

    Of course, the AST was extended to cope with the new rules. New classes
    were created: 
         Program - represents the program
         Variable - a variable in the declaration
         VariableExpr - a variable inside an expression
         
    Grammar:
       Program ::= VarDecList ':' Expr   
       VarDecList ::=  | VarDec VarDecList 
       VarDec ::= Letter '=' Number
       Expr::=  '(' oper Expr  Expr ')' | Number | Letter
       Oper ::= '+' | '-' | '*' | '/'
       Number ::= '0'| '1' | ... | '9'
       Letter ::= 'A' | 'B'| ... | 'Z'| 'a'| 'b' | ... | 'z'
